WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Cesar/Documents/GitHub/FPinGA/xdc/top_level.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/top_level_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Cesar/Documents/GitHub/FPinGA/xdc/top_level.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/top_level_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/top_level_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net recorder/finish0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin recorder/finish_reg_i_1/O, cell recorder/finish_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
INFO: [DRC REQP-165] writefirst: Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (fft/U0/i_synth/xfft_inst/non_floating_point.arch_d.xfft_inst/pe_gen[0].natural_order_input.PE/FB_1.BF_1/MEM/blk_ram.use_bram_only.mem/depths_3to9.ram_loop[0].use_RAMB18.SDP_RAMB18E1_36x512) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
